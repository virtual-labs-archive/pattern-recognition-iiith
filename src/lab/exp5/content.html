	     <p> Linear perceptrons allow us to learn a decision boundary that would separate
	     two classes. They are very effective when there are only two classes, and they are
	     well separated. Such classifiers are referred to as discriminative classifiers.</p>
	     <p> In contrast, generative classifiers consider each sample as a random vector, and
	     explicity model each class by their distribution or density functions. To carry out
	     the classification, we compute the likelihood that a given sample belong to each of the
	     candidate classes, and assign the sample to the class that is most likely. In other words,
	     we need to compute P(&#969<sub>i</sub>/x) for each class &#969<sub>i</sub>. However, the
	     density functions provide only the likelihood of seeing a particular sample, given that
	     the sample belongs to a specific class. i.e., the density functions provide us p(x/&#969<sub>i</sub>).
	     The Bayes rule provides us with an approach to compute the likelihood of the class for
	     a given sample, from the density functions and related information.

	     Consider the following quote from a 2000 article in the Economist on the Bayesian Approach 
	     [<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/%7emurphyk/Bayes/economist.html">link</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">]:</span>

	     <p><i>"The essence of the Bayesian approach is to provide a mathematical rule explaining 
		how you should change your existing beliefs in the light of new evidence. In
		other words, it allows us to combine new data with their existing knowledge or
		expertise. The canonical example is to imagine that a precocious newborn observes 
		his first sunset, and wonders whether the sun will rise again or not. He assigns 
		equal prior probabilities to both possible outcomes, and represents this by placing
		one white and one black marble into a bag. The following day, when
		the sun rises, the child places another white marble in the bag. The
		probability that a marble plucked randomly from the bag will be white (i.e., the 
		child's degree of belief in future sunrises) has thus gone from a half to two-thirds. 
		After sunrise the next day, the child adds another white marble, and the probability 
		(and thus the degree of belief) goes from two-thirds to three-quarters. And so on. 
		Gradually, the initial belief that the sun is just as likely as not to rise each
		morning is modified to become a near-certainty that the sun will always
		rise." </i></p>

	     <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

	     <p> In terms of classification, the Bayes theorem allows us to combine prior probabilities,
	     along with observed evidence to arrive at the posterior probability. More or less, conditional
	     probabilities represent the probability of an event occurring given evidence. To better
	     understand, Bayes Theorem can be derived from the joint probability of
	     A and B (i.e. <i>P</i>(<i>A,B</i>)) as
	     follows:</span></p>
